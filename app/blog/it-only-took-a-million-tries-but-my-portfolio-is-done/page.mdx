I'm pretty sure every developer reading this has _that moment_ where you decide to build a portfolio. In your head, it's a sleek, perfect site, complete with a dark/light theme toggle and all sorts of cool animations. Let me guess, you never found the time to actually finish it. Yeah, I didn't either, three times tbh... until now. This time, decided to skip the Figma, wireframes, or any sort of a design. I just wanted to get it out of my head. I grabbed a pen, sketched a rough idea, and built it using raw Next.js and TailwindCSS.

I won't bore you with the details of how I tried building my portfolio with a different framework each time, only to lose motivation halfway through. Long story short, I spent more time creating elaborate Figma designs or starting with building a theme switcher than actually building the site. I kept getting distracted and lost motivation when I didn't see any real progress.

I just needed a personal space where I can share my random shower thoughts and the new ideas that frequently pop into my head. It'll be a mix of many things - sometimes I'll dive into some technical jargon, other times I might us it to vent about whatever's on my mind. Back in college, I was pretty active on [Medium](https://medium.com), but it feels a bit formal for me now. I want this blog to be a place where I can write freely without worrying about making it perfect.

Honestly, Next.js made the whole process way easier than I expected. I don't need to manually read markdown files, parse them, and turn them into React components during build. [Next.js and MDX!!](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) Just create a `page.mdx` file instead of `page.tsx` with some minimal configuration; kaboom! your blog is done. I made a little `BlogLayout` component to handle titles and meta information. Here's how a blog post will look like:

```tsx
import BlogLayout from "_/blog-layout";

export const data = {
  title: "It Only Took a Million Tries, But My Portfolio Is Done!",
  keywords: ["Next.js", "MDX", "Portfolio"],
};

<BlogLayout data={data}>

Now, let's talk about the dark theme. I must admit, I'm guilty of always asking if a site has a dark mode. But here? Nope. No theme switcher here. That's rightâ€”this site only comes dark. Sometimes you just have to embrace the dark side and make life a little simpler!

I'm pretty pleased with how things turned out. It's simple, it's responsive, and it has reusable UI elements. I even managed to dynamically generate OG images for each blog post. Yep, [Next.js makes that possible too!](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response) Here's a peek at what it looks like for this blog.

I ran a Lighthouse audit and was delighted to see a near-perfect score. I had to tweak a few minor warnings to hit the perfect score with a confetti for my little victory. Yippee!

So, yeah, there you have it. my portfolio is finally live and I couldn't be happier. Sometimes, simple is just better. Check out the repository at [AbhayVAshokan/abhay.app](https://github.com/AbhayVAshokan/abhay.app). I'll be posting ramdom stuff here, so stay tuned!
